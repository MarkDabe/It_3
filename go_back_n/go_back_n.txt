IMPORTANT PER PROFESSOR ALDEER AND SLIDE 75 OF LECTURE 3 - 4 (A SCREENSHOT IS FOUND IN FILE BY THE NAME SLIDE 75):
The receiver only acks the highest-numbered frames received in sequence (THIS IS WHAT IS IMPLEMENTED ON THE RECEIVERS SIDE)


sender sends 5 packets at a time.  The receiver only acks the highest-numbered frames received in sequence.
If the received a packed it wasn't expecting it acks the highest-numbered packet received in sequence.
the sender sends the packet having sequence number = ack sequence + 1

sequence number starts at 0 till 9

window size for sender is set to 5

window size for receiver is set to 1


IMPORTANT: data transfer is all done in one serversocket.accept() session (only one socket is opened used throughout the session)

to use:
python sender.py
python receiver.py

to test:

set the variable ignore_3_once to True. This makes the sender add the packet 3 to the time out dictionary but never sends it to mimic a lost packet.
after the timeout of one seconds it resends it.
