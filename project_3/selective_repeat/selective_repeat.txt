selective repeat

sender sends 5 packets at a time with a timeout for each of them, if sender doesn't receive the ack for the packet within the timeout period it resends the packet

sequence number starts at 0 till 9

packet timeout is set to 1 second

window size for sender is set to 5

window size for reciever is set to 5

if receiver receives a packet within its window it sends the sender an ack packet for the packet it receive. if the packet did not lie within the window it discards it

IMPORTANT: data transfer is all done in one serversocket.accept() session (only one socket is opened used throughout the session)


to use:
python sender.py
python receiver.py

to test:

set the variable ignore_3_once to True. This makes the sender add the packet 3 to the time out dictionary but never sends it to mimic a lost packet.
after the timeout of one seconds it resends it.
